## What is Shadcn?

Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

This is **NOT** a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return <h1>Hello, NextJs!</h1>
}
```

## What do you mean by not a component library?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
